  'orders:read', 'orders:create', 
  'menu:read', 'categories:read'
]
kitchen: [
  'orders:read', 'orders:update', 
  'menu:read', 'categories:read'
]
```

### **Security Constants**
```typescript
ADMIN_EMAIL: 'arindamdawn3@gmail.com'
SESSION_TIMEOUT: 24 hours
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS: 5
LOGIN_ATTEMPT_WINDOW: 15 minutes
MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH: 8 characters
```
